# Introduction

- Python is high level(programmer friendly not machine friendly) programming language. Programmer not required to worry about low level activities(memory management, destroying objects, security), it is taken care by language itself.
- Python is general purpose (not specific to particular area) i.e Desktop apps, web apps, Data science apps, ML apps, etc.
- **Guido Van Rossum** developed python in 1989 while working in **National Research Institute** in *Netherland*, python was released officially on Feb 20th, 1991 to public.
- Why python is more popular these days?
    - Due to market requirements on below points
        - Need a simple language and easy to understand
        - Very concise code / less code to get work done
        - Data science, data analysis, AI, ML, Deep learning, Neural network, etc are in trend
    - For all these reasons python is best suitable programming language

# Easiness of Python language

- Code to print Hello World in various language

```c
// C language
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    printf("Hello World");
}
// Have to compile and then run the code
```

```java
// Java language
public class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.print("Hello World");
    }
}
// Have to compile and then run the code
```


```python
# Python language
print("Hello World")
# Just run the code using command python test.py
```
- In python we are not required to declare the type of variable explicitly unlike c, c++, java. Programming languages where data type need not be explicitly declared is called **dynamically typed languages**, based on provided value at runtime data type for variable will be considered.
- If we required to explictly have to mention the data type for variables like in c, cpp, java these type of languages are called **statically typed languages**

# Why Python?

- **Guido Van Rossum** was fan of **The Complete Monty Python's Circus** comedy show telecasted in BBC channel  from 1969 to 1974

# Python All Rounder

- **C** is functional programming language
- **C++**, **JAVA** are Object oriented programming languages
- **Perl**, **Shell Script** are scripting languages
- Python has 
    - Functional programming features from **C** (Write a function and call the function to execute)
    - OOPS features from **C++** (Write a class and create objects)
    - Scripting programming features from **Perl**, **Shell Script** (Write few statements and these statements will be executed one by one)
    - Modular programming features from **Modula 3**
- Python is all rounder programming language
